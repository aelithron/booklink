# Book Link
An aesthetically-pleasing tool for ethically linking to books.
## The Problem
I saw this interesting viewpoint from [Richard Stallman's website](https://stallman.org/amazon.html):
> "If you want to use a URL to identify a book, please don't use an Amazon page! Doing so promotes Amazon."

Personally, I agree with this. Who wants to promote big tech and billionaires when sharing links to books?
However, most people wouldn't take the time to find another way.
## The Solution
A simple, aesthetically-pleasing way to share books that promotes ethical and small booksellers over billion-dollar megacorps.
This is a Next.JS based website for doing just that.
